# Migrate to Containers

Welcome to the [Migrate to Containers](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/containers) sample code repository. This repository contains example, scripts and guides to showcase best practices for using Migrate to Containers to migrate legacy workloads from virtual machines to containers running on [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke) or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run).
